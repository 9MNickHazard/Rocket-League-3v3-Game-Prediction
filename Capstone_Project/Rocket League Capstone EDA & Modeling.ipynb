There are many stats that have two formats, either percentage or time, of which I picked percentage in every case. This was due to the fact that, in Rocket League, quite a few games end in a forfeit either due to rage quitting or one team is simply up to much and the other team forfeits. In a game that was forfeit, a player may have done very well but still have a lower score on a stat that only showed total time. The stats that use percentage would not be affected by a game that ran for less than the full 5 minutes, or for that matter, over 5 minutes in the event of an overtime (if scores are tied at the end of the game)."

    "There were very few nulls in this dataset to begin with, so picking either median or mean to fill the values with was a fairly arbitrary choice, as the tiny number of filled nulls would hardly affect the outcome of the modeling. I decided to go with median, as the data on ballchasing.com tends to have more stats from higher level players (as higher level players are more likely to set up their account to upload their games to ballchasing so they can track their own stats), and so to mitigate a higher than average value for the nulls, median is less affected by outliers."
